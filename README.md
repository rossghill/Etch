# life-drawing-tool
This is a web app designed to simulate a life drawing class, using high-resolution photos from Unsplash

This app is a simple to use tool to provide high quality model images for sketching.

##Why did I build this?

After using similar tools online I noticed that the images provided are often of an inconsistent theme and/or low quaility, or locked behind a paywall.

Sketch uses high resolution images from a range of photographers, provided by Unsplash. 
These images are free to use, download, copy and manipulate under the Unsplash License.
The images are all of clothed models, both to provide a family-friendly experience as well as provide an alternative to other tools which predominantly feature nude models.

Initial settings allow selection of pose time and model type.


##Features that may be included in the future...

Pause pose
Avoid duplicate poses during a single session
Option to source direct from Unsplash API (experimental)
