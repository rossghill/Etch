# Etch
Etch is a simple to use web app designed to simulate a life drawing class, using high-resolution photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

## Why did I build this? :woman_artist:

After using similar tools online I noticed that the images provided are often of an inconsistent theme, low quaility and/or locked behind a paywall.

* Sketch uses high resolution portrait images from a range of photographers, provided by Unsplash. 
* These images are free to use, download, copy and manipulate under the [Unsplash license](https://unsplash.com/license).
* The images are all of clothed models, both to provide a family-friendly experience as well as provide an alternative to other tools which predominantly feature nude models.

Initial settings allow selection of pose time and model type.

## Run on your local machine :art:

After cloning or downloading the repo, in the root folder:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser of choice.


## Features that may be included in the future... :man_artist:

* Online version
* Pause pose
* Avoid duplicate poses during a single session
* Landscape/ nature option
* Option to source direct from Unsplash API (experimental)
