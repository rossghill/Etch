# Life Drawing Tool
This is a simple to use web app designed to simulate a life drawing class, using high-resolution photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

## Why did I build this?

After using similar tools online I noticed that the images provided are often of an inconsistent theme, low quaility and/or locked behind a paywall.

* Sketch uses high resolution images from a range of photographers, provided by Unsplash. 
* These images are free to use, download, copy and manipulate under the [Unsplash license](https://unsplash.com/license).
* The images are all of clothed models, both to provide a family-friendly experience as well as provide an alternative to other tools which predominantly feature nude models.

Initial settings allow selection of pose time and model type.


## Features that may be included in the future...

* Pause pose
* Avoid duplicate poses during a single session
* Landscape/ nature option
* Option to source direct from Unsplash API (experimental)
